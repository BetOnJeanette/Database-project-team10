      <p>
        Hello, my name is Kyle Janssen. This is my second year here at Wayne State, and hopefully
        last before i finish my bachelors degree in Computer Science. I started out at Schoolcraft College
        for 2 years to get the majority of my gen ed courses out of the way.
        <br/>
        Sadly, I don't have much working experience in the field yet, covid kind of threw a wrench in that.
        Instead of that, ill mention a couple electives i took that i enjoyed massively (electives because im sure most of us has had similar courses when it comes to required ones).
        One being Human Computer Interactions, which was a course that covers the basics in all fields involving
        how a user can interface with technology. Another really interesting elective i took here has
        been Intro to Cyber-Physical Systems, which taught me how engineering will cross with computer science (we coded a lot using arduino).
        Those were probably my favorite electives i took, but i also have dabbled a bit in networking and cybersecurity either on my own
        time or at schoolcraft.
